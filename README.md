# WinForms Scheduler Getting Started

The [WinForms Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/winforms-ui-controls/scheduler?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-scheduler-github-samples) control (Event Calendar) allows users to schedule and manage appointments through an intuitive user interface. It has different view modes such as day, week, work week, and month view to display appointments in. It also provides support to drag and drop an appointment from one time slot to another time slot. Its rich feature set includes recurring appointments, appointment drag and drop, appearance customization, globalization and localization and more.

It is used to [create appointments](https://help.syncfusion.com/windowsforms/scheduler/getting-started#schedule-appointment?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=winforms-scheduler-github-samples) and events, organize meetings, view group schedules, and much more.
